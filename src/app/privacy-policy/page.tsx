                        ASTI Academy has put in place various physical,
                        electronic, and managerial procedures to try to
                        safeguard and secure the information we collect. For
                        example, we provide strong encryptions to store certain
                        information and have stringent managerial checks and
                        password change policies in place. The information we
                        collect is stored with third-party data centers which
                        have a holistic security model with seven levels of
                        security. Please note that the Company shall not be
                        liable for any misuse or loss of information carried out
                        by such a third-party data center. Furthermore, we also
                        rely on your cell phone’s strong security model to
                        ensure that there is no information or security leak
                        unless intentionally processed for authentication.{" "}
